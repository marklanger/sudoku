* Tasks
** DONE solve basic puzzle (when there is only one potential value)
** TODO simple test that solution is complete
** TODO make solver automatic
** TODO ? solve if the puzzle offers two possible solutions (never one single option)
** DONE research more complex ways to solve
** TODO pull interateSolve row/col/sq updaters into separate function (probably simplest to make generic)
** TODO refactoring [0/3]
   - [ ] look into refactoring the iterations through the board
     - Object.entries()
     - can you just use id's 1-81/0-80 instead of using cycling through all rows and columns?
       - if not, can you make a function that iterates through the rows appropriately, so that is not repeated?
   - [ ] make interateSolve() run functions of varying complexity
     - current iterateSolve() should probably be checkForMissingNumbers() or something;
   - [ ] iterateSolve() >> solve()
** TODO tests
* General Notes
** React in HTML
   - does not work with JSX, without adding babel or some other factors for JSX
   - for now, working on just using React.creatElement to build what I need
     - see: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html
* Brainstorming
