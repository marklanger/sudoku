* Tasks
** DONE solve basic puzzle (when there is only one potential value)
** TODO simple test that solution is complete
** TODO make solver automatic
** TODO ? solve if the puzzle offers two possible solutions (never one single option)
** TODO research more complex ways to solve
** TODO ? complex test that the solution is complete
** TODO pull interateSolve row/col/sq updaters into separate function (probably simplest to make generic)
** TODO refactoring [0/3]
   - [ ] look into refactoring the iterations through the board
     - Object.entries()
     - can you just use id's 1-81/0-80 instead of using cycling through all rows and columns?
       - if not, can you make a function that iterates through the rows appropriately, so that is not repeated?
   - [ ] make interateSolve() run functions of varying complexity
     - current iterateSolve() should probably be checkForMissingNumbers() or something;
   - [ ] iterateSolve() >> solve()
** TODO tests
* General Notes
* Brainstorming
